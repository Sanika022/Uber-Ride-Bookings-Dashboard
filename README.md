**Uber Ride Bookings Dashboard**

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard using an Uber NCR ride bookings dataset. 
The dashboard provides insights into booking trends, revenue performance, ride completion status, customer behavior, and service quality. 
The end goal is to transform raw ride-level data into meaningful visual analytics that support data-driven decision-making.
The project follows a complete BI workflow including data loading, cleaning, modeling, DAX measure creation, visualization, and dashboard design.

Project Objectives:
1. Analyze overall ride booking performance in the NCR region.
2. Track completed vs cancelled rides and completion rate.
3. Identify revenue contribution by vehicle type.
4. Understand customer payment preferences.
5. Discover top pickup locations.
6. Evaluate service quality using driver and customer ratings.

Tools & Technologies Used-
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling and dashboard creation
Microsoft Excel – Source dataset
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Measures and KPIs
Power Query Editor – Data cleaning and transformation

Dashboard Visualizations:
1. KPI Cards- Total Bookings, Completed Rides, Cancelled Rides, Total Revenue, Completion Rate, Average Ride Distance
2. Graphs:

i) Ratings by Vehicle Type (Clustered Column Chart)- Compares average driver and customer ratings across vehicle types.

ii) Revenue by Vehicle Type (Clustered Column Chart)- Highlights the highest revenue-generating vehicle categories.

iii) Payment Method Distribution (Pie Chart)- Shows customer payment preferences (UPI, Cash, Card, etc.).

iv) Total Bookings by Booking Status (Donut Chart)- Shows the split of completed, cancelled, and other booking statuses.

v) Bookings Trend by Months (Line Chart)- Displays monthly booking volume over time.

vi) Top 10 Pickup Locations (Clustered Bar Chart)- Identifies demand hotspots based on booking count.

Insights:
1. Majority of bookings are successfully completed.
2. Certain vehicle types contribute significantly more revenue.
3. UPI is the most preferred payment method.
4. Specific pickup locations show consistently high demand.
5. Ratings vary across vehicle categories, indicating service quality differences.

Conclusion:
This Power BI dashboard demonstrates how raw operational data can be transformed into actionable insights through effective data modeling and visualization. The project highlights strong fundamentals in data analytics, DAX, and dashboard design.
